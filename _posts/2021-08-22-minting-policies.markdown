Minting is the process in which units of a custom token can be created or destroyed based on rules defined in a policy. 
A blockchain with native asset/token support such as Cardano defines minting policies as a base-layer primitive permitting anyone holding its principal token (e.g. ADA) to mint custom tokens grouped under a minting policy identifier.
These `policyID` policy identifiers paired with details from the official 
[Token Registry](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry/tree/master/mappings) 
provides all the additional information for a custom token.

## Native Script / Multisig Policies
Coming soon

## Plutus Script Policies
Coming soon

## Fungible vs Non-Fungible 
Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) provide uniqueness guarantees across the entire blockchain.
This property of uniqueness can be defined in a Multisig policy.

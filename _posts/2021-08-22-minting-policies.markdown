Minting is the process in which units of a custom token can be created or destroyed based on rules defined in a policy. A blockchain with native asset/token support (e.g. Cardano) defines these minting policies as a base-layer concept to permit anyone holding its principal token (e.g. ADA) to mint custom tokens.

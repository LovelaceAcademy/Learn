Cardano is the next evolution of blockchain technology with the goal
to provide a more **open**, **inclusive** and **sustainable** 
financial system that scales for global use. 

Based on [published peer-reviewed research](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/) in collaboration with the world's top universities and academic minds, their latest advancements follow a methodical path from academic proofs to formal specifications and finally to robust software that can be proven to work as intended. 

This well-established path from research to engineering and product development uniquely identifies Cardano amongst the world's top blockchain platforms and permitted innovation at scale without compromising on energy consumption, security or decentralisation.

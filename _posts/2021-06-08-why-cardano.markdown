Cardano is the next evolution of blockchain technology with the goal
to provide a more **open**, **inclusive** and **sustainable** 
financial system that scales for global use. 

Based on [published peer-reviewed research](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/) in collaboration with the world's top universities and academic minds, their latest advancements follow a methodical path from academic proofs to formal specifications and finally to robust software that can be proven to work as intended. 

This well-established path from research to engineering and product development uniquely identifies Cardano amongst the world's top blockchain platforms and permitted innovation at scale without compromising on energy consumption, security or decentralisation.

## The Cardano Revolution

We explained in [our video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM0_V53_kGo) that Cardano is already:
 - The most decentralised blockchain platform 
   - 3,000+ <a class='tooltips tooltipstered' data-tooltip-content='Stake pools in Cardano are the equivalent of mining pools in traditional proof-of-work blockchains'>stake pools</a> distributed globally

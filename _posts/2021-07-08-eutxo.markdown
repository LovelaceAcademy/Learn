Extended UTxO (EUTxO) as the name suggests, extends the [UTxO model](https://learn.lovelace.academy/getting-started/transactions-utxo-and-metadata/) to enable Smart Contracts on Cardano through:
- Transactions propagating and encapsulating **state** (arbitrary data) in addition to tokens 
- A new address type derived from [turing-complete](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7284/what-is-turing-complete) scripts. These scripts are executed to validate that a UTxO can be spent by Transactions

This approach fits perfectly with the pure functional paradigm that Cardano is based on, however it also requires a shift in thinking compared to the RPC-like request/response smart contract implementations of other Blockchains.

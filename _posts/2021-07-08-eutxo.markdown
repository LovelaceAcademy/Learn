Extended UTxO (EUTxO) as the name suggests, extends the [UTxO model](https://learn.lovelace.academy/getting-started/transactions-utxo-and-metadata/) to enable Smart Contracts on Cardano by:
- Incorporating a new type of address derived from turing-complete scripts executed before a UTxO can be spent by a Tx
- Propagating encapsulated state in addition to values

This approach fits perfectly with the pure functional paradigm that Cardano is based on, however it also requires a shift in thinking compared to traditional RPC-like smart contract implementations of other Blockchains.

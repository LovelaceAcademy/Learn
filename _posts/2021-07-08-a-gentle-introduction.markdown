Plutus is both a full application framework (Plutus Application Framework) and a native language (Plutus Core) for smart contracts on Cardano. Plutus is written in, and is a subset of [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). 

## Haskell Foundations
The foundations of Cardano is written in Haskell because its pure functional paradigm promotes clearer abstractions, an natural path from academic proofs to formal specifications, and more comprehensive testability. These factors allowed Haskell to solidify itself as the language of choice for high assurance software.

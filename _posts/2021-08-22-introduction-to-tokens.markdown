Tokens are representations of assets and facts that can be minted (created/destroyed), stored and transferred within a blockchain. In the context of blockchains the terms *token* and *asset* are interchangeable.

## Multi-asset Blockchains
Unlike single-asset blockchains like Bitcoin or Litecoin which only support a single principal token (i.e. BTC and LTC), a multi-asset blockchain supports minting, storing or transferring custom tokens on top of its principal token. Examples of multi-asset blockchains are Ethereum and Cardano which support an infinite amount of custom tokens in addition to their principal token (i.e. ADA and ETH).

## Tokenisation of Assets
After Bitcoin introduced sound digital money and trusted decentralised recordkeeping, Ethereum built on top of these foundations to introduce tokenisation of custom assets on the blockchain. This allowed users to define custom tokens representing:
 - Fungible Assets: Units of value grouped under a specific category (e.g. currency, loyalty points, game points), each unit indistinguishable from another under the same group
 - Non-Fungible Assets (NFTs): A single unit representing an asset or fact that is unique across the entire blockchain (e.g. art collectables, identity, real estate)

## Native Token / Assets
A multi-asset blockchain has native token/asset support if all its custom tokens follow the same base-layer accounting rules as its principal token. The following advantages arise from native token/asset support:
 - Cheap, fast and reliable transactions for all tokens
 - Universal interoperability of all tokens
 - Simple minting process for custom tokens
 - Ability to bundle minting/transfer of multiple tokens in a single transaction (e.g. Token Bundles)

Examples of blockchains with native token/asset support are Cardano, Ergo and Algorand.

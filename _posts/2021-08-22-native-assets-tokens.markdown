Tokens are representations of facts or values that can be minted (created/destroyed), stored and transferred within a blockchain. The terms *token* and *asset* are interchangeable when used in the context of blockchain even though tokens are themselves a subclass of assets which reside on-chain.

## Tokenisation of Assets
Bitcoin introduced the concept of sound digital money and trusted decentralised recordkeeping on the blockchain. Ethereum built on top of these foundations to introduce on-chain tokenisation of: 
 - Fungible Assets: Units of value grouped under a specific category (e.g. currency, loyalty points, game points), each unit indistinguishable from another under the same group
 - Non-Fungible Assets (NFTs): A single unit representing a fact or value that is unique across the entire blockchain (e.g. art collectables, identity, real estate)


## Multi-asset Blockchains
Unlike single-asset blockchains like Bitcoin or Litecoin which only support a single principal token (i.e. BTC and LTC), a multi-asset blockchain supports minting, storing or transferring custom tokens on top of its principal token. Examples of multi-asset blockchains are Cardano and Ethereum which support an infinite amount of custom tokens on top of their principal token (i.e. ADA and ETH).

## Native Token / Assets
Further, a multi-asset blockchain can be labelled as having native token/asset support if all of its custom tokens follow the same base-level accounting rules (i.e. store and transfer amongst addresses) as its principal token. Native token/asset support give the advantage of permitting token bundles in a single transaction with no overhead when that transaction is executed. Examples of blockchains with native token/asset support are Cardano and Algorand.

Tokens are representations of facts and values that can be minted (created/destroyed), stored and transferred within a blockchain. The terms *token* and *asset* are interchangeable when used in the context of blockchain even though tokens are themselves a subclass of assets which reside on-chain.

### Tokenisation of Assets
Bitcoin introduced the concept of sound digital money and trusted decentralised recordkeeping on the blockchain. Ethereum built on top of these foundations to introduce on-chain tokenisation of: 
 - Fungible Assets: Units of value grouped under a specific category (e.g. currency, loyalty points, game points), each unit indistinguishable from another under the same group
 - Non-Fungible Assets (NFTs): A single unit representing a fact or value that is unique across the entire blockchain (e.g. art collectables, identity, real estate)

### Multi-asset Blockchains
Unlike single-asset blockchains like Bitcoin or Litecoin which only support a single principal token (i.e. BTC and LTC), a multi-asset blockchain supports minting, storing or transferring custom tokens on top of its principal token. Examples of multi-asset blockchains are Cardano and Ethereum which support an infinite amount of custom tokens on top of their principal token (i.e. ADA and ETH).

### Native Token / Assets
A multi-asset blockchain has native token/asset support if all its custom tokens follow the same base-layer accounting rules as its principal token. The following advantages arise from native token/asset support:
 - Cheap, fast and reliable transactions for all tokens
 - Universal interoperability of all tokens
 - Simple minting process for custom tokens
 - Ability to bundle minting/transfer of multiple tokens in a single transaction (e.g. Token Bundles)

Examples of blockchains with native token/asset support are Cardano, Ergo and Algorand.

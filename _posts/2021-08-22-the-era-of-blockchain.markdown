The world is only just starting to understand the implications of Blockchain's 
disruptive technology and its decentralised socioeconomic movement some twelve and a half years
after [Bitcoin's first block](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048).
Since then, the Blockchain industry has surpassed a $2 Trillion dollar market cap on the back of major advancements in its technological underpinnings, mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies as the frictionless payment rails of the internet, its acceptance as an asset class with huge asymmetric potential, and the tremendous growth in the number of next generation of products and services built on top of its infrastructure. 

To dig deeper on the technical foundations and benefits of Blockchain, please refer to our video [Making Sense of Blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev75v-9LU5I).

## Huge Opportunities in Blockchain Development 
Never before has the world had access to a globally open, trusted and resilient financial system without a central intermediary prone to corruption and mismanagement. With this decentralised technology anyone in the world can have an economic identity with equal unfettered access to:
 - Reliable and transparent financial services
 - Seamless global trade and commerce
 - Irrefutable recordkeeping of ownership and other facts
 - An interconnected metaverse of platforms for gaming and interactive experiences

Even with the explosion of innovation in this space it is still early days to be a builder or visionary planning the next generation of Blockchain-powered products and services. The upfront effort to learn and build on top of this new tech stack will yield enormous returns in the coming years. There has not been this level of opportunity since the early days of the internet or the advent of mobile apps. 

## Cardano

On top of the amazing opportunity for growth is the unique opportunity to build on top of the strongest foundations in the Blockchain space. Cardano was designed and built carefully for long-term sustainability and a passionate community pushing it forward.

So far, all of our interaction with Cardano has been through the `cardano-cli` and a locally running `cardano-node`. While it is perfectly fine for one-off tasks and goals, building products/protocols which require complex interactions entirely in a scripting languages will prove difficult to maintain and scale.

With `cardano-node` as the centrepiece, there are many downstream components utilising the [node-to-client protocol](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/cardano-network/networking-protocol#node-to-clientipcoverview) to 
 - Perform ad-hoc queries through the `local-state-query` mini-protocol
 - Submit transactions via the `local-tx-submission` mini-protocol 
 - Propagate, consume and persist chainDB data through the `chain-sync` mini-protocol

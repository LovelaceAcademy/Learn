Navigating any Blockchain ecosystem in order to begin participating can sometimes be a daunting task so we have prepared this guide to help builders and visionaries get started with Cardano.

## Roles for Everyone
It is a common misconception that Cardano has a steep learning curve and in-depth knowledge of Haskell/Plutus is required to be a builder or visionary on Cardano. In fact, there are many roles for anyone wishing to take part in the Cardano revolution. One or more of the following roles could apply to you. 

### Investor
- Basic ADA [Investor/Trader](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/markets/): Holds ADA on an exchange, prays for price appreciation 
- Network Participant: Holds ADA on a personal wallet and participates in decentralisation by staking it and earning additional ADA every 5 days
- Informed Supporter: [Understands the ecosystem](https://github.com/input-output-hk/essential-cardano/blob/main/essential-cardano-list.md), uses products and/or collects Native Assets
- Active Community Member - [Governance](https://cardano.org/governance/) Voter or Contributor. Educates others in the Cardano Forum/Telegram/StackOverflow/

### Digital Creative
- UX Designer for Platforms and Products
- NFT Content Creator 

### Builder
- Stake Pool Operator (SPO)
- DApp Developer - On-chain Smart Contract builder
- Integration and Infrastructure Developer - Off-chain integration pieces e.g. APIs, SDKs, CLIs, etc.
- Tooling Developer - Wallets and 
- Analytics Developer - Block/Token/Stake Pool/Tx Explorers 

That said, Lovelace Academy as an education platform is mostly geared to the developers of Cardano so most of the subsequent content will be technical in nature. 

## Foundational Knowledge
As Blockchain sits at the intersection of cryptography, software engineering, distributed systems and economics it only makes sense for beginners to be familiar with the basics of each field. It is important to understand basic computer science, modern cryptography, good software engineering practices and scaling techniques. 

### Key Differences vs Traditional Software Development
- Everyone has a copy of the database. 
- Everyone validates the integrity of the data.
- Any change to the data has to come from a transaction. 
- Every transaction has a transaction fee.
- Finalisations are not immediate. A by-product of eventual consistency in distributed systems with additional protection against invalid forks.
- On-chain computation comes at a cost. 
- On-chain computation is limited to values that already exist. i.e. No integration outside the Blockchain itself apart from Oracle data.

In Web3 architecture the distinction between frontend and backend still exists, with the backend consisting of on-chain and off-chain components while the frontend defines the UI and integration via off-chain SDKs.

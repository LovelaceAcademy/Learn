title: 'Welcome to Learn @ Lovelace Academy'
---

Lovelace Academy is a blockchain education platform to streamline your development journey with Cardano and Web3. We aim to make it easier for learners to navigate the developer ecosystem, understand key concepts and learn best practices while building on this exciting new stack.

We believe that education is the key to a more productive, collaborative and fairer world. Further, we firmly believe that everyone should be granted the same access to education in order to learn technical skills and have equal opportunity to apply their skills in the real world.

Our goals are three-fold:
 1. Provide **free educational content** for everyone who wishes to understand Cardano and Blockchain technology
 2. Host a [**community-powered learning platform**](https://discord.com/invite/cqQBvBpXzR) that rewards engagement and collaboration
 3. Allow anyone to demonstrate their knowledge and practical experience through **certifications** (_currently in development_)
